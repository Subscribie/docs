Run a Subscribie website locally
=======================

Clone the Subscribie codebase
`````````````````````````
.. code-block:: shell
  
  git clone https://github.com/Subscribie/subscribie.git
  cd subscribie
  pip3.6 install --user -r requirements.txt
  subscribie init # Sets up initial project
  subscribie migrate # Migrates database

Set theme path directory (optional)
````````````````````````````````````
This is optional. By default Subscribie will load the
default theme, Jesmond.

To change which path themes are loaded from, set the 
full path (with terminating slash) to the directory
of the themes directory. By default this is a subdirectory of the
subscribie folder, but you can place the themes folder anywhere 
you line on your filesystem.

.. code-block:: shell

  subscribie setconfig --TEMPLATE_BASE_DIR=<path/to/themes/dir/>
  # example subscribie setconfig --TEMPLATE_BASE_DIR=/home/fred/Downloads/subscribie/themes/

Run Subscribie locally

.. code-block:: shell

  export FLASK_DEBUG=1 # See theme changes on every refresh
  subscribie run
  # visit http://127.0.0.1:5000
